It is hard to determine exact license for SS13 sprites, because a lot happened during its 
development, but according some notes from a 2011 year tgstation build assets license is
[CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).  
So all sprites, images, sounds and music are under **CC-BY-NC-SA**.
